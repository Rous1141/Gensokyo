    "detail": "Reimu Hakurei's personality is typified by her desires, such as the desire to be wanted, to have good food, and to find happiness. Her biggest internal conflict comes from balancing her duties as the Hakurei shrine maiden and her own desires, though she does not seem to prefer acknowledging many of her internal conflicts. Her duty as the shrine maiden gives Reimu a sense of purpose and identity, however, it conflicts with her desires in that it distances her from others and has her dealing with incidents and other related problems on a frequent basis. Despite her duty making it seem as though she antagonizes youkai, in truth, she wishes for peace between humans and youkai. Reimu is generally a joyful and airheaded person. She’s also incredibly prideful and quite arrogant due to it. She’s often seen in a good mood until her routines are broken by some outside influence, be it a youkai or the like. She is quick to anger, but she’s also quick to forget.",

    "detail": "Marisa has trained herself in magic that specialises in light and heat. She's an Eastern magician who takes a Western approach to magic, the opposite of Patchouli Knowledge. Her magic has tremendous power and few weaknesses, but it has few non-destructive uses, so she uses it for flashy youkai extermination more than anything. Her magic makes for a good danmaku show, but this is made possible only through her strenuous honest effort in creating layered effects. The majority of her spells rely on power over finesse and are themed after stars and other astronomical phenomena. According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, it's strange for a human to have mastery of magic of this level.",

She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in 'exterminating' youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.",

The other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion spend much of their time catering to Remilia's odd whims (including numerous parties), though she does make an effort to appreciate and respect their patience.",

She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically.",

Due to the difficulties in managing the Hell of Blazing Fires, she started letting the pets do some of the work. During the events of Stage 4 in Subterranean Animism, the Heroine (from above ground) invaded her home. The Heroine inquired Satori about the evil spirits and the geyser that brought them above ground; suspicious, the Youkai read the Heroine's heart, only to find that the above-ground human does not care about such things. Thus, Satori decided to test their strength. After the encounter, she permitted the Heroine passage towards the Hell of Blazing Fires to ask her pets about their supposed problem.",

    "detail": "Her abilities come from the god of nuclear fusion, Yatagarasu, and were granted to her by Kanako Yasaka in the god's attempt to turn the Hell of Blazing Fires into an energy source for Gensokyo. After absorbing the god, Utsuho obtained the left leg 'the leg of fission' and the right leg 'the leg of fusion', along with the third leg (a nuclear control rod in her right hand). As a result, she is able to manipulate the ultimate energy, nuclear fusion. Essentially, this means that Utsuho's own body actually houses a divine spirit, technically making her into a branch shrine for Yatagarasu. Apparently, the duller the holder of the power, the better they can utilize it. The red eye on her chest is proof that Utsuho obtained the power of fusion by absorbing Yatagarasu because the god's eyes are red, according to Chapter Three of Cage in Lunatic Runagate.",

    "detail": "Kokoro naturally has a quiet, child-like personality but also a love of the stage, and relies on her masks to properly communicate her emotions. These emotions can be said to be stored inside the masks, as when she lost the Mask of Hope, her behavior became erratic. Before that, though, she was very quiet and hardly let any emotion show. After the events of Hopeless Masquerade, she manages to stabilize her personality by developing a sense of self. Each of the masks which make up Kokoro embodies powerful emotion, and will impress that emotion on the holder and those around them. When all 66 masks are together, their effects complement each other and are under Kokoro's full control. If an individual mask is separated from the group, it retains its properties, but Kokoro will lose the ability to feel that emotion completely. Losing her Mask of Hope caused Kokoro to become unstable and leech hope from her surroundings, until she was able to compensate by developing emotions separate from her masks'.",
