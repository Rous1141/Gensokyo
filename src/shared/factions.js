  "detail": "Among the people living at the village are Keine Kamishirasawa and Hieda no Akyuu. The village has an as of yet unnamed leader, a florist, a woodcutter, a teahouse, a tofu shop, youkai exterminators, and more. There's also the Kirisame-ya second-hand shop here which is owned by Marisa's father. Some stores stay open late into the night to cater exclusively to youkai. Humans from the village mostly avoid involving themselves in youkai actvities, although some humans have become uneasy with the dominance of youkai in Gensokyo. In the recent past, a secret society was rumored to have existed, intending to learn secrets from research into the beginnings of human and youkai residence in Gensokyo with a goal of asserting human control and expelling youkai from the land.",

  "name": "Former Hell",
  "detail": "The palace is a Western-style mansion with what appears to be many stained glass windows on a chequered floor. In the courtyard is a large hole that leads to the Hell of Blazing Fires below. It's said that the Palace was constructed after the Underworld was separated from Hell. Satori Komeiji took control of the Palace and managed it by herself with the help of her pets, keeping it relatively peaceful. Of her pets, Rin Kaenbyou's duty is to carry corpses to the Remains of Blazing Hell for the heating of Former Hell and Utsuho Reiuji is to maintain that heat. The other pets' duties were said to be tending the garden and playing with Satori's sister, Koishi Komeiji.",

  "detail": "The Scarlet Devil Mansion (紅魔館 Koumakan), also referred to as the Scarlet Manor or Scarlet Mansion, is a European-style mansion owned by Remilia Scarlet. It is located on a ridge on the edge of the Misty Lake. From the outside, there are scarlet-colored windows, but there aren't many windows because of the nature of its vampire residents. There are plenty of rooms without windows at all, too. Through the dialogue of Touhou Hisoutensoku and multiple literary works, it can be said that the entrance to the mansion is usually not fully closed. There is a clock tower on the roof, but the bell on it only rings at night. The inside of the mansion is much larger than is apparent from the outside. This is due to Sakuya Izayoi's ability to manipulate time and space.",
